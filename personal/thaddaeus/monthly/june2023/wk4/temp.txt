Research Questions:

Identifying New AGN Classes: Clustering methods can be employed to explore the possibility of discovering new classes or subclasses of AGN based on their spectral features. By applying unsupervised clustering algorithms to the SDSS spectra, you can examine if there are any distinct groups that have not been previously classified. This could potentially reveal novel AGN types or shed light on the existence of subclasses within known AGN types.

Spectral Classification: Another interesting research question involves investigating the effectiveness of clustering algorithms for accurate AGN spectral classification. By training clustering models on a labeled dataset of known AGN types (e.g., Seyfert galaxies, quasars, blazars), you can evaluate their performance in correctly grouping AGN spectra into the respective categories. This analysis could demonstrate the potential of clustering methods as an alternative or complementary approach to traditional supervised classification techniques.

Intrinsic AGN Variability: AGN are known to exhibit variability in their spectral features over time. By applying clustering algorithms to a large dataset of AGN spectra, you can explore if distinct spectral groups emerge that correspond to different stages of AGN activity or variability. This investigation could provide insights into the underlying physical processes driving AGN variability and potentially reveal new aspects of AGN behavior.

Correlations with Other AGN Properties: AGN properties, such as redshift, luminosity, or host galaxy characteristics, can provide valuable context and additional information. By examining correlations between the spectral features obtained from clustering and other AGN properties, you can explore potential relationships and uncover new insights. For example, do certain spectral groups predominantly correspond to AGN with specific redshift ranges or luminosities? Investigating such correlations can help in understanding the connection between AGN spectral characteristics and their broader astrophysical context.
